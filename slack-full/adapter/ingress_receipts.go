// IngressReceiptStore is the durable ingress ledger for company-room
// events (Slack company-rooms Phase 1b). Every admissible company-room
// POST becomes exactly one receipt on disk before the transport is
// acknowledged; the file system is the deduplication authority across
// Slack redeliveries and adapter restarts.
//
// Durability contract:
//
//   - Admit is the admission linearization point and is claim-and-content
//     atomic. The complete receipt (including the full inner Slack event
//     and outer identifiers, which routing and crash replay both require)
//     is written to a temp file, fsynced, then hard-linked (os.Link) to
//     its origin-keyed final name. os.Link is atomic and fails with
//     EEXIST if the name already exists, so the first writer wins and a
//     redelivery observes the existing receipt. There is no window in
//     which a claim (the final name) exists without its content (the
//     linked inode already holds the fully-fsynced bytes).
//   - Update is a generation-checked atomic rewrite (temp + rename + fsync
//     of file and directory). A lost race is detected via the generation
//     counter (ErrStale) rather than silently overwritten.
//   - Files are 0600 inside a 0700 directory. Filenames derive from the
//     origin through safeStorageID, which hashes long or hostile
//     components so a crafted ts/channel can neither escape the directory
//     nor produce an unbounded name.
//
// A crash between the temp write and the link, or between a rename's
// components, leaves at most a stray "ingress-*.tmp" orphan — never a
// half-written receipt. The orphan is harmless (it is ignored by every
// scan) and swept by the adapter's tmp janitor.
