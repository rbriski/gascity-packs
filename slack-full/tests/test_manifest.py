"""Structural validation for manifest/app.json (pack-relative).

This pack ships a canonical Slack app manifest at ``manifest/app.json``
(pack-relative — i.e. relative to this slack-full/ directory). The
manifest is the source of truth for the slack-full's OAuth scopes,
bot events, and slash commands.

These tests guard against accidental breakage of that file:

  * the JSON parses cleanly,
  * the top-level keys Slack's manifest schema requires are present,
  * the scopes and bot_events arrays are non-empty (catches a
    well-meaning edit that empties them out),
  * scopes are unique and sorted (style guard — keeps diffs readable).
