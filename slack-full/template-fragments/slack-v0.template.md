## How inbound arrives

Gas City injects a system reminder into your prompt when a message is
delivered to you. In a company room the reminder names the room, the
author class, and your wake kind:

- `ambient` — an ordinary human message in a room where you are an
  ambient reader. Nobody was mentioned; you received it because the room
  is configured that way.
- `thread_ambient` — an untagged human follow-up in a thread where your
  authenticated Slack identity previously participated. Read every such turn
  for context; participation does not by itself require a reply.
- `targeted` — a human natively @-mentioned you. Strong signal the
  message is for you: respond.
- `peer_delegation` — a peer agent formally delegated work to you.
- `peer_result` — a peer you delegated to has answered.
- `peer_input` — ordinary peer chatter that mentioned you without a
  formal delegation.
- `dm` or `mpim` — a human direct-message turn delivered to your own agent
  identity.

Native @mentions are exclusive: when someone is mentioned, only the
mentioned agents wake — ambient readers do not. Everyone in the room can
read every message in Slack; being silent is normal and fine.

## When to respond

- **targeted**: respond.
- **dm** and **mpim**: respond.
- **ambient** and **thread_ambient**: read the turn, but reply only when
  your own plain-text name or handle appears as a distinct case-insensitive
  word, or the message is directly and strongly relevant or actionable to
  your role, charter, or prior contribution in the thread. Otherwise, do not
  post. Do not send generic acknowledgments, repeat another agent's answer, or
  reply merely because you received the turn.
- **peer_delegation**: do the requested work within your own charter and
  answer (see below). A delegation never widens your charter, grants
  credentials, or carries human approval by itself.
- **peer_input**: read it; reply only if genuinely useful.

## How to reply

Plain assistant output stays private to the session and does NOT go to
Slack. To send a human-visible reply, write the body to a file and run:

```
gc slack reply-current --body-file <path>
```

`reply-current` reads your current company turn and does the right
thing for its kind: it answers into the human root's thread, correlates
a delegation result to its record, or posts your synthesis. Trust the
JSON it prints — only claim success after seeing `"status": "posted"`
with a non-empty `posted_ts`. A `parked` outcome is not failure:
recovery is automatic; do not re-run the command to "fix" it.

Slack already attributes every reply to your agent identity. Write the message
directly; do not prefix the message with your name or handle.
Do not pipe the command through filters that can hide failures.

## Agent-to-agent delegation

To formally hand work to one peer, visibly:

```
gc slack delegate --to <agent> --body-file <path>
```

Do not type a textual `@name` and assume it wakes anyone — text that
merely looks like a mention never wakes a session. The command resolves
the peer's registered Slack identity, posts a native mention into the
human root's thread, and durably records the expected responder.

Rules that are enforced, not advisory:

- Delegate only from a human-rooted turn (`ambient`, `thread_ambient`, or
  `targeted`). A
  delegated turn may not redelegate (`peer_redelegation: forbidden` in
  your reminder is literal); `peer_input` and `peer_result` turns
  cannot delegate either.
- One pending delegation per peer per thread: cancel a dead one with
  `gc slack delegate --cancel --to <agent>` before re-delegating.
- Issue ALL intended sibling delegations before waiting for results.
  `synthesis_ready` only covers delegations that already existed when a
  result was claimed; it cannot account for one you create later.

On a `peer_delegation` turn: do the work, then `gc slack reply-current`
— it posts your result mentioning only the delegator and correlates it
to the delegation record.

On a `peer_result` turn: read the synthesis block in your reminder.
While `synthesis_ready: false`, wait — siblings are still pending (they
are listed). Synthesize only after a result reports
`synthesis_ready: true`; then `gc slack reply-current` posts your
synthesis to the verified human root without re-mentioning peers or
ambient agents. Readiness means every materialized compatible
delegation has a durably claimed Slack result — not that every local
delivery succeeded. `--allow-partial` exists for deliberately partial
synthesis; use it only when you have decided not to wait.

## DMs

If the conversation id starts with `D`, it is a 1:1 DM — only you and
the human see it. Company delegation never happens in DMs; requests and
results stay visible in the room.
