# Gstack Lite Contract

- The pack root exposes skills only: no active `agents/`, `commands/`, or
  `formulas/` directories.
- `gstack-lite` is the default end-to-end delivery skill.
- The persistent Mayor remains Sol/high; explicit research and planning
  deliverables route to a persistent, attachable `gc.research-planner`
  conversation on the Sol/max `sol-research` provider by default; raw
  `--no-formula` beads are background-only.
- Interactive planning autostarts from the submitted brief, makes concrete
  kickoff progress, and emits an exact structured `READY_FOR_ATTACH` safe
  checkpoint. The Mayor queues autonomous continuation before exposing the
  attach command; attachment steers work but never starts or resumes it.
- The research-planner role is a singleton in every current rig; the audit
  rejects a new rig until it receives the same provider binding and cap.
- Every user-facing research engagement publishes an HTML/CSS bundle under the
  rig's reports namespace, registers an active library card, and verifies its
  live tailnet URL before completion.
- One bead has one implementation owner and one immutable source-head lease.
- Repository-native checks precede model review; a green baseline may be
  inherited only when bound to the same immutable head and check definition.
- The same checked immutable candidate is exposed to required CI, configured
  external PR review bots, and one different-family review for material changes.
  Each bot has SHA-bound run/comment evidence; a configuration skip is not a
  timeout. Bounded timeout/unavailable results are explicit.
- Findings are deduplicated in one exact-head artifact before the single repair
  allowance begins. All applicable surfaces evaluate the exact repaired head.
  The same bounded-result rule applies, and an unavailable required surface
  blocks merge unless repository protection explicitly exempts it and that is
  recorded. Only a blocking consolidated re-review fails upward; safety always
  blocks.
- At most one repair owner may write after consolidated review. The prior owner
  must be drain-acknowledged or forcibly closed before reassignment.
- Rejected branches remain durably reachable with their exact commit, diff, and
  evidence until an approved successor carries them or another durable remote
  reference preserves them. Rescue carries work forward by default; rebuild
  from protected main requires a recorded architecture, provenance, or security
  reason.
- Protected publication, deployment, and a behavior canary remain distinct
  terminal states.
- Retired delivery graphs under `../deprecated/` are historical artifacts only
  and must not appear in the active city catalog.
- Final accounting records wall clock, provider lanes, queue time, checks,
  review, repair, deployment, rejected attempts, and human intervention.
- Comparable terminal accounting uses the versioned `gc.delivery/v1` metrics
  object on durable product beads. Deterministic rollups exclude ephemeral and
  control-plane churn and report field-level telemetry coverage.
- Operational health is a separate snapshot of supported `gc doctor --json`
  output. Advisory warnings do not become universal delivery blockers.
