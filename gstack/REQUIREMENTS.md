# Gstack Lite Contract

- The pack root exposes skills only: no active `agents/`, `commands/`, or
  `formulas/` directories.
- `gstack-lite` is the default end-to-end delivery skill.
- The persistent Mayor remains Sol/high; explicit research and planning
  deliverables route to a persistent, attachable `gc.research-planner`
  conversation on the Sol/max `sol-research` provider by default; raw
  `--no-formula` beads are background-only.
- Interactive planning uses a two-phase handoff: an initialization-only brief
  must produce an exact structured `READY_FOR_ATTACH` acknowledgement before
  the attach command is exposed. Attachment never overlaps a model turn.
- The research-planner role is a singleton in every current rig; the audit
  rejects a new rig until it receives the same provider binding and cap.
- Every user-facing research engagement publishes an HTML/CSS bundle under the
  rig's reports namespace, registers an active library card, and verifies its
  live tailnet URL before completion.
- One bead has one implementation owner and one immutable source-head lease.
- Material changes receive one different-family review against an immutable
  candidate head.
- At most one repair owner may write after review. The prior owner must be
  drain-acknowledged or forcibly closed before reassignment.
- Repository-native checks precede model review; a green baseline may be
  inherited only when bound to the same immutable head and check definition.
- Protected publication, deployment, and a behavior canary remain distinct
  terminal states.
- Retired delivery graphs under `../deprecated/` are historical artifacts only
  and must not appear in the active city catalog.
- Final accounting records wall clock, provider lanes, queue time, checks,
  review, repair, deployment, rejected attempts, and human intervention.
- Comparable terminal accounting uses the versioned `gc.delivery/v1` metrics
  object on durable product beads. Deterministic rollups exclude ephemeral and
  control-plane churn and report field-level telemetry coverage.
- Operational health is a separate snapshot of supported `gc doctor --json`
  output. Advisory warnings do not become universal delivery blockers.

Run the contract checks from the repository root:
